//Event - something that happens on the page
//mouse click, mouse moving, key press, other events

//event listener: wait for an event to happen and react to it

//addEventListener is a method, one of the ways to listen to an event in JavaScript
//you need an event handler as well. The event listener just says what event are we manipulating
//the event handler defines what manipulation, what function, what action
//is the program going to do once it listens to this specific event.

//the first argument is the listener, the second element is the handler (callback function)

//we define the function on the event handler but we dont call it, its javascript engine that calls the function

//this function will only be called when the event happens
