const numbers = [2, 3, 1, 9, 5];
numbers.sort();
//sort method converts each element to a string and sort it in the array
//the elements gets sorted in crescent order
console.log(numbers);

numbers.reverse()
console.log(numbers);
//it does the same as sort, but on de-crescent order

//so its pretty easy to use w numbers and strings
