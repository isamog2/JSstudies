<h1> JavaScript is not an interpreted language </h1>
</div>

<div class="Engine">
<p> JS engines are programs that executes JS code.</p>
<p> Browsers have their own JS engine for example. </p>
</div>

<div class="HeapAndCallStack">
<p>Every JS Engine always has a CallStack and a Heap.
  Heap -> Unstructured memory pool where the objects are stored.
  Call stack -> where the code is executed using execution context.
</p>
</div>

<div class="Definitions">
<h2> Call stack is *where* its executed, but *how* is it done? </h2>
  <p>Computers only understand 0s and 1s. Let's call that "machine code".
  Source code: the fun stuff you write on your IDE.

  Your source code needs to be translated into machine code for the computer to understand it.
  This translation is done through compilation or interpretation</p>
</div>

<div class="Compilation">
  <p>Compilation-> entire code is converted into machine code at once.
  Source code gets written into a portable binary file that can be executed by a computer.
  The execution of this machine code portable file, to get the program running, can happen way after compilation.</p>
</div>

<div class="Interpretation">
  <p>Code is read and executed at the same time.
    Interpreter runs through the source code,
  translates it to binary and executes it line by line.
  The translation happens right before the execution on each line.
  That's way too slow and low performance, that's how JS used to work.</p>
</div>

<div class="JITCompilation">
  <p>JS now does Just-in-time (JIP) compilation:
  Entire code is converted into machine code, doesn't gets stored on a portable file
  because it's executed immediately. </p>
